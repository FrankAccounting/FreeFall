# Mission Statement
Create a game where the player skies down a mountain and flees the abdominal snowman. 

After the player successfully out skies the snowman they must spend a night dodging the snowman in the lodge

# Things we care about:

 1. Items that break when they are improperly combined
2. Repeatability driven by item collection
3. Pretty or poetic panels 
4. Randomly generated tiles. You might never win 
5. Cant go back and you cant hold on to all the items
6.  Crafting
7.  Timed Choices, Less then 5 seconds, some are too long to read
